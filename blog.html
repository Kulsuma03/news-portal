                    It can be updated and

                <h5 class="card-title text-success">Differences Between Arrow and Regular Functions</h5>
                <p class="card-text"><span class="fw-bold ">Regular function:</span> Inside of a regular JavaScript
                    function, this value (aka the execution context) is dynamic.

                    The dynamic context means that the value of this depends on how the function is invoked. In
                    JavaScript, there are 4 ways you can invoke a regular function.

                </p>
                <p class="card-text"><span class="fw-bold ">Arrow function:</span> The behavior of this inside of an
                    arrow function differs considerably from the regular function's this behavior. The arrow function
                    doesn't define its own execution context.

                    No matter how or where being executed, this value inside of an arrow function always equals this
                    value from the outer function. In other words, the arrow function resolves this lexically.

                <h5 class="card-title text-success"> difference Between forEach(), map(), filter() difference</h5>
                <p class="card-text"><span class="fw-bold ">The map() method:</span> The map() method loops through each element in array and calls the provided function for each element. This method creates a new array and doesnâ€™t alter the original array.

                </p>
                <p class="card-text"><span class="fw-bold ">The forEach() method:</span> forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text"><span class="fw-bold ">The filter() method:</span> The filter() method in JavaScript creates a new array with the elements that satisfies the provided condition. This method calls a provided function for each element in array and verifies the condition given in the provided function and passes only those elements that satisfy the given condition.

                </p>
                <p class="card-text"><span class="fw-bold ">The find() method:</span> The find() method is used to find all the descendant elements of the selected element.The find() method search through all the child elements only.

                <h5 class="card-title text-success"> Template literals (Template strings)</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, for string interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called tagged templates.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.
